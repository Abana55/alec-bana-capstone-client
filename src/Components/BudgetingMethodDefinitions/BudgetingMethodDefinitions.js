            <strong>Zero-Based Budgeting:</strong> Every dollar of income is assigned a specific purpose, whether it's spending or saving, ensuring that your income minus your expenses equals zero. This method is beneficial for those who want to have complete control over their finances and avoid overspending.

            <strong>Pay Yourself First:</strong> Prioritizes saving by setting aside a portion of your income for savings or investments before allocating money to other expenses. It's beneficial for those who want to ensure they consistently save a portion of their income.

            <strong>70/20/10 Rule:</strong> Similar to the 50/30/20 rule, but with a focus on allocating more towards living expenses and less towards wants. It's beneficial for those who have higher living costs or are focused on debt repayment.
